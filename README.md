# Sidekiq::Repeat

Another recurrent job scheduler for Sidekiq. Clockless.

## Credits

This gem takes the clockless scheduling approach of (and a lot of code from) [Sidekiq::Dejavu](https://github.com/felixbuenemann/sidekiq-dejavu) by Felix BÃ¼nemann and adapts it to the in-code configuration style of [Sidetiq](https://github.com/tobiassvn/sidetiq) by Tobias Svensson. Thanks to both for their great gems.

## Usage

### cron-style recurrence notation

```ruby
require 'sidekiq'
require 'sidekiq-repeat'

class TestWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker
  include Sidekiq::Repeat::Repeatable

  # Every Sunday at 3AM.
  repeat { '0 3 * * 0' }

  def perform
  end
end
```

### Sidetiq/ice_cube-style recurrence notation

Check [the code](lib/sidekiq/repeat/mini_ice_cube.rb) for documentation.

```ruby
[...]
  # Every other hour.
  repeat { hourly(2) }
[...]
```

## Development

To run the tests with different Sidekiq versions, we use the [Appraisal](https://github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal) gem.

```sh
# setup
bundle exec appraisal install

# test with Sidekiq 4
bundle exec appraisal sidekiq-4 rake test

# test with Sidekiq 5
bundle exec appraisal sidekiq-5 rake test
```
